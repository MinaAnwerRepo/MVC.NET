chapter 21 : The Managed Heap and Garbage Collection 

Managed Heap Basics: for every type in dot net you use memory to use and load it.
1- Allocate memory for the type that represents the resource (usually accomplished by using C#’s new operator).
2- Initialize the memory to set the initial state of the resource and to make the resource usable.
The type’s instance constructor is responsible for setting this initial state.
3- Use the resource by accessing the type’s members (repeating as necessary).
4- Tear down the state of a resource to clean up.
5- Free the memory. The garbage collector is solely responsible for this step.
