introduction  : 

=> microsoft started in 2002 with ASP.NET ASMX-based XML web service that allowed other .NET and non-.NET clients to call it but it available only with http protocol 

=> the 1.0 release of .NET provided support for Remoting. This allowed
developers to write services that weren’t necessarily tied to the HTTP protocol. Similar to ASMX-based web services,
.NET Remoting essentially provides object activation and session context for client-initiated method calls. The
caller uses a proxy object to invoke methods, and the .NET runtime handles the serialization and marshaling of data
between the client’s proxy object and the server’s activated service object.

=> 2006 : Microsoft included Windows Communication Foundation service with framework 3 
        
=>  Advantages of using webApi : 
   
   1- Configurations : 
    the concept of endpoint and contract is not exists . 
   
   2- Rest By Default : 
   in WCF the address maps directly to file .svc , here url maps to controller and action method .
   
   3- Abstraction with Routes : 
    simply Routes give ASP.NET webApi service layer of abstraction 
	you can change code behind as much as you need and service will work normally as the URL does not changed .
