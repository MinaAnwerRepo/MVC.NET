//------------------partial Views-------------------------------------------------

make aview as ashared between many views and called it with @html.Partial 


=> you can put shared view in controller folder and this means that it will be seen by this controller only 
   and you can also put it in shared folder where all views can see it . 

=> you can simply use @html.Partial(viewname , object that this view build over)


//-------------------Lesson 52--------------------------------------------------------------
//-------------------Part 53 Difference between html.partial and html.renderpartial------------


both of them is used to render Partial view 

Difference between html.partial and Html.RenderRartial is that :

=> Partial : return MvcHtmlString which can be assigned to avariable and manipulating it if required . 

=> RenderRartial  : Returns void and output will be written directly to the screen  

which one is better in performance ? 

from a performance perspective , rendering directly to the output stream is better 
so RenderRartial() does exactly the same thing and it better for performance over Partial .
